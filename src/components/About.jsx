          About Our Plant Watering System
          </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Our automated plant watering system continuously monitors soil moisture, 
            humidity, temperature, and plant height. Whenever your plant needs water, 
            the system activates a pump to keep it optimally hydrated. No more 
            guesswork—just healthy, thriving plants!
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relazed">
            Built using an Arduino, Node.js, OpenCV, Flask, and React, our system provides 
            a simple dashboard to view real-time sensor data and trigger manual 
            watering if desired. Whether you’re a gardening enthusiast or just looking 
            for an easy way to care for your plants, this system has you covered.
